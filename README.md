This is a simple RPA macro recorder

It helps to record mouse+keyboard steps. ( See the record and play buttons above )

It can repeat actions for every rows of 'datasheet'. ( See rpa_test worksheet for example )

See the example worksheets for self-learning.

Not for replacing any tools in the market. ( They took many many years to build )

The purpose also to help user to capture the record scripts via recording.
So that we can understand and convert to the next platform very quickly.
